# Success Metrics & Risks

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
To measure the success of the transition system:

1.  **Average Turnaround Time (TAT)**: Time from request submission to final closure. (Target: < 3 days for Offboarding).
2.  **First-Time Approval Rate**: Percentage of requests approved without needing corrections.
3.  **Asset Recovery Rate**: % of company assets (laptops, phones) successfully returned within 24 hours of LWD.
4.  **System Adoption**: % of transitions processed via the system vs. email/paper.

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Approval Delays** | High | Medium | Automated email reminders every 24 hours; Escalation to manager's boss after 48 hours. |
| **Data Entry Errors** | Medium | High | Dropdown menus for standardized data; Validation logic on forms (e.g., LWD cannot be before Join Date). |
| **Asset Loss** | High | Low | Finance settlement is strictly blocked until IT marks assets as "Returned". |
| **User Resistance** | Medium | Medium | "One-Click" approval links in emails; Mobile-friendly dashboard. |

## 🧪 SWOT Analysis (BA Perspective)

*   **Strengths**: Centralized audit trail; Automated compliance enforcement.
*   **Weaknesses**: Requires accurate data in the core HR system to function well.
*   **Opportunities**: Integration with Active Directory for auto-account locking.
*   **Threats**: Dependency on manual updates from IT if integration fails.
